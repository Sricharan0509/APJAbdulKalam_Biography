                that
                played a significant role in shaping his character, values, and life's journey. Born on October 15,
                1931, in

                father,
                Jainulabdeen, was a devout Muslim and an imam (priest) at a local mosque, while his mother, Ashiamma,
                was a
                homemaker who also supplemented the family's income by selling handcrafted items. The family's ancestral
                occupation was boat-building, a skill that had been passed down through generations.

                rooted
                in faith, humility, and hard work. These values formed the bedrock of young Kalam's upbringing and would
                go
                on to shape his character and worldview.

                The Kalam family's simple living can be seen in various aspects of their daily life. Their residence was
                a
                modest, single-story house in Rameswaram, and their lifestyle was characterized by frugality and
                self-sufficiency. This upbringing instilled in Dr. Kalam a deep sense of humility and a h3 work
                ethic

                Kalam
                to pursue his studies diligently.

                His father, Jainulabdeen, was a source of inspiration and wisdom. He instilled in his son the importance
                of
                integrity, righteousness, and a commitment to truth. These values became guiding principles in Dr.
                Kalam's
                life and would later influence his leadership style and decision-making as a scientist and statesman.

                nature.
                These early experiences ignited Dr. Kalam's fascination with science and the natural world.

                the close-knit community of Rameswaram.
